# CS166: Database Management Systems

In this course, we will discuss various issues arising in the context of databases and the principles un-
derlying the design of modern database systems. We will examine both theoretical and implementation issues.

Topics will include logical design, data models, normalization, query languages, file and index struc-tures, concurrency, 
transaction processing, and as time permits, topics of recent interest such as data warehousing, spatial databases, and data mining.
There will be a class project, a mid-term and a final exam, and several homeworks.

Prerequisites: CS 100 and CS 111.
